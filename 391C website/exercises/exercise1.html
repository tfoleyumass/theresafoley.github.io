        <h2>Concise bio (or tagline)</h2>
        <p>
            I am a senior at UMass Amherst studying Computer Science and English, specializing in Professional Technical Writing and Creative Writing. 
            My coursework includes advanced studies in computing, software development, literary analysis, and technical communication. 
            In my free time, I enjoy reading, going to the library, writing, and exploring creative and technical projects.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Longer bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about the intersection of technology and storytelling, blending technical precision with creative expression. 
            My studies in Computer Science focus on software development, ethical computing, and problem-solving, while my English coursework 
            deepens my skills in literary analysis, writing, and communication. I enjoy working on projects that merge these interests, 
            such as technical documentation, content creation, and digital storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, I am an avid reader drawn to a wide range of genres, from classic literature to contemporary fiction and poetry. 
            My writing explores themes of revolution, mystery, and societal change, often delving into existential questions and supernatural elements. 
            I find inspiration in both historical and speculative narratives, using writing as a way to engage with complex ideas and challenge perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have a deep appreciation for cinema and enjoy exploring films across different genres, from thought-provoking dramas 
            to visually stunning sci-fi and historical epics. Whether analyzing storytelling techniques or appreciating cinematography, 
            movies provide another lens through which I explore narrative and creativity.
