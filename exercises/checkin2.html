            <h1>Protect Our Oceans</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The ocean is vital to life on Earth, providing food, oxygen, and regulating our climate. However, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten marine ecosystems.</p>
        
        <h2>How can we help?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce plastic use and properly recycle waste.</li>
            <li>Support sustainable seafood choices.</li>
            <li>Participate in beach clean-ups and conservation efforts.</li>
            <li>Advocate for policies that protect marine habitats.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Simple actions to protect marine life</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use reusable bags, bottles, and straws to reduce plastic waste.</li>
            <li>Choose eco-friendly sunscreens to prevent reef damage.</li>
            <li>Limit water waste to reduce runoff pollution.</li>
            <li>Educate others about ocean conservation efforts.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>Healthy oceans provide livelihoods for millions of people and are home to an incredible diversity of life. By making small changes, we can protect this invaluable resource for future generations.</p>
        
        <p> Here is a fun fact</p>

        <p>Delicate corals in the Gulf of Maine and off Cape Cod have thrived for over 1,000 years, growing just millimeters per year while providing vital fish habitats. Some resemble small trees in vibrant hues, others drift like ghostly white veils. Yet, a single fishing trawl can destroy them. As scientists uncover new species, protecting this fragile underwater world becomes ever more vital.</p>
